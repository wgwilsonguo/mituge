				<h2> Who We Are </h2> 

				<p> The MIT Undergraduate Energy Club (known as UGE) aims to develop the next generation of leaders in energy by fostering an active community of over 50 undergraduates. We serve as a bridge between MIT undergraduates and the larger energy world, creating a network of undergraduates, faculty, alumnae, and professionals to promote opportunities in both academia and industry. From the first ever MIT Energy Career Fair to intercollegiate mixers to a research symposium, we connect over 300 students in the Greater Boston area with a shared passion for energy. </p>

				<h3>“Started from the bottom now we’re here”- Canadian rapper Aubrey Drake Graham </h3>
				<p> A perfect quote summarizing the Energy Career Fair. Started out as a mere gathering event, it grew into a brand new career fair at MIT with over 20 company sponsors and 300 student participants in the year of 2016. This year, with a team of 15 strong, the 2017 Energy Career is going to exceed last year’s performance! The primary goal is to provide a bridge connecting students with a passion for energy to representatives in the energy industry. Wait what? Opportunities for students beside Course 6? Don’t wait, don’t hesitate, check out our committee and get updated for more information! </p>

				<h2> Climate Action Committee</h2> 
				<h3> Because we care about our grandchildren </h3>

                <p>
                The Climate Action committee recognizes the importance of approaching climate
                change from an activism and policy standpoint here at MIT. Our campaign focuses on
                pushing for a carbon fee and dividend at the state and federal levels. Climate
                Action's Endorsement, Lobbying, and Visibility teams work toward this in concert,
                and anyone is welcome to join or help lead these groups. We work jointly with
                national campaigns including the Citizen's Climate Lobby and Our Climate, as well
                as on-campus groups like Fossil Free MIT.

				<h2> Maker Committee</h2> 
				<h3> Designing and building the future </h3>

				<p> In the maker committee, we really like to design and make things. We start drafting our ideas out on a CAD software, and then we bring these ideas to life using circuits and machinery in the MIT hobby shop. Last year, we made a power generating bicycle that powered LED lights. This year, we are focusing on creating solar powered powerbanks from scratch. In addition to learning to CAD, we train in machinery, create circuits, and our members have the opportunity to be creative and design their own projects.</p>
